\fIserver_params\fR can be changed to whatever you want to, it all just passes options to \fBhlds_run\fR.
Leave \fIserver_dll\fR var empty to disable \fBmetamod\fR and have a pure vanilla server without any mods.
By default the server is run by user \fIhlds\fR with account locked.
You need to use \fBsudo su \- hlds\fR if you plan to do further configuration in the server directory.
\fBamxmodx\fR and \fBmetamod\fR are included and enabled by default.
\fByapb\fR bots are uncluded too but disabled, if you want to enable them uncomment the line with \fIyapb.so\fR in the
\fI/home/hlds/.steam/cs16/cstrike/addons/metamod/plugins.ini\fR file.
.SH FILES
